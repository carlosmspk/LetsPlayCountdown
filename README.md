What if you could beat Rachel and Susie on their life jobs?

## Beat Susie
Find the best word using 9 supplied letters. Couldn't find Oxford Dictionary words for download, so maybe some of the results might not work.

## Beat Rachel
Find the closest number to the supplied target using the 6 supplied numbers. Unfortunately, couldn't find a way to do things such as "(a+b)*(c+d)", most of the times you get a lot of good answers, but it's not that rare that you need to apply something that requires parenthesis. Also, ignore priority, just do stuff from left to right.
